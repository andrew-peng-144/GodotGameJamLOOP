Another stupid blasted loop thingy appeared in MY yard last night! I swear I'd kill that wizard in the super evil castle myself if I didn't have me wife and kids to think about.

Wizard: Well, well. It's been far too long since my last intruder. I would vanish you instantly, but I admit I didn't expect a defenseless rabbit.
{{Globals.MC}}: I don't need a sword to kick your ass.
Wizard: Calm down. Don't be foolish. What, you sold yourself out to do the humans' bidding?
{{Globals.MC}}: No. You need to stop creating these dimensional loops that destroy our land, and our homes.
Wizard: Hmph. It can't be helped. I'm not doing it on purpose. It's just a side effect of my magic.
{{Globals.MC}}: Not ordinary magic, I take it.
Wizard: No. And I don't care if it destroys that stupid village of yours. You've got your priorities all wrong. If only you knew, rabbit... that no one there deserves to live!

Since The Bramble is being evacuated, we might start seeing more hybrids showing up around here. I guess that's good for you, huh? 
These new ones better not start destroying our buildings again, or steal our food, or break into homes.
